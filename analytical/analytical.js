// Easy level

// answer no-01: the answer would be false cause 0.1 + 0.2 equal would be 0.33333333 
// which is not strictly equal to 0.3.
// but if we do math.floor(0.1+0.2) then the strictly equal to 0.3 will true..

Result: 0
Answer: false â€” due to floating point precision errors in JavaScript.
number cutt bacause of false calculation  0.1 + 0.2 = 0.30000000000000004 but you've wrritten "0.33333333"
